# Gamepad Navigator

Gamepads are popular devices, and a lot of work has been done to extend its usefulness to a wide variety of people.
Some of the game controllers, such as the
[Xbox Adaptive controller](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-adaptive-controller/8nsdbhz1n3d8?rtc=1), the
[Logitech G Adaptive Gaming Kit](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gamepads/adaptive-gaming-kit-accessories.html),
and the [one-handed controllers](https://www.evilcontrollers.com/ps4-one-handed-controller), strive to include a
broader range of people in traditional PC and console gaming.

The idea behind the Gamepad Navigator is to develop a solution that makes it possible to navigate using a game
controller. It would offer the users with a means to use their game controllers to navigate, as an alternative to a
keyboard or mouse.
